            Hello. Please buy my duck. He is a very well behaved duck, but lately he has been making strange noises.
            At night I hear him quacking from the pond. It is one of my favorite sounds to hear. It is comfort. It
            lulls me sleep. Three nights ago I was having a hard time sleeping. My husband Ronald snored beside me.
            I could not close my eyes, as I had the daunting feeling that someone was watching me. I went to the 
            window to see if I could get the attention of the duck so that he might start quacking. It was like my
            lullaby. As I approached the window I could see him in the pond below. I tapped the window like I normally would.
            The duck looked toward the window, and through the dark of the night it seemed that he was staring right at me.
            His eyes were red. He opened his beak like usual, but instead of his normal pleasent quack, he began to scream.
            I did not know ducks could scream.
            Every night since then, once the moon is up, the duck will start to scream. I have not slept in days. I still feel
            like I am being watched.
            Please
            buy my duck.
